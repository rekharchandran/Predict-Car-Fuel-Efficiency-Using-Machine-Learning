# Predict-Car-Fuel-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning
### Introduction
The automotive industry is extremely competitive. With increasing fuel prices and picky consumers, automobile makers are constantly optimizing their processes to increase fuel efficiency.

you are given a dataset with various characteristics of new cars sold in the U.S. in 2010; the list of characteristics is presented below. You will learn the relationship between fuel efficiency (the dependent variable Y) and various other characteristics (independent variables X). You will use the learned relationship to predict fuel efficiency of new cars in 2012 based on various other characteristics of these cars (X_new). You will also predict the performance of your predictions in terms of expected prediction loss. The loss function you are facing is absolute loss: L(err)=|err|.
