# Predict-Car-Fuel-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning
### Introduction
The automotive industry is extremely competitive. With increasing fuel prices and picky consumers, automobile makers are constantly optimizing their processes to increase fuel efficiency.

you are given a dataset with various characteristics of new cars sold in the U.S. in 2010; the list of characteristics is presented below. You will learn the relationship between fuel efficiency (the dependent variable Y) and various other characteristics (independent variables X). You will use the learned relationship to predict fuel efficiency of new cars in 2012 based on various other characteristics of these cars (X_new). 
### List of car characteristics in the dataset:
•	EngDispl ~ engine displacement (in liters): how large is the engine


•	NumCyl ~ number of cylinders constituting the engine

•	Transmission ~ type of transmission (manual, automatic, automated manual, etc., with different numbers of gears)

•	FE ~ fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon: the larger the number, the less fuel the car uses per mile)

•	AirAspirationMethod ~ air aspiration method (natural, supercharged or turbocharged)

•	NumGears ~ number of gears

•	TransLockup ~ whether the transmission can be locked up at fixed ratios (applicable mainly to continuously variable transmissions)

•	TransCreeperGear ~ whether the transmission has a creeper gear (a low gear used for driving slowly in difficult terrains when off-roading)

•	DriveDesc ~ type of drivetrain: 4WD (four wheel drive), PT4 (part-time four wheel drive),  AWD (all wheel drive), FWD (front wheel drive) and RWD (rear wheel drive)

•	IntakeValvePerCyl ~ number of intake valves per cylinder

•	ExhaustValvesPerCyl ~ number of exhaust valves per cylinder

•	CarlineClassDesc ~ class of the car: subcompact, compact, midsize, …, SUV, …

•	VarValveTiming ~ whether the engine has variable valve timing

•	VarValveLift ~ whether the engine has variable valve lift

You may learn more about the different characteristics and the relationships between them online. E.g. Wikipedia has useful descriptions of variable valve timing and variable valve lift.
